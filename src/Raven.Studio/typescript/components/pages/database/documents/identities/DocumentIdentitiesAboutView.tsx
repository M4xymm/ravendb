                    An <strong>identity</strong> is a unique document ID in the database. It is generated by the server
                    when a pipe suffix is added to the requested document ID during document creation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The identity ID is composed of the collection name and a number that is continuously incremented per
                    document creation.
                </p>
                <p>
